Finished all of the database functions.
Add two new database functions and updated the list of functions on design doc:

Added wheel to requirements.txt and tested it on new virtual environment
Made sure login mechanism and homepage are fully functioning. (Other routes do not crash but are mostly empty)
Updated route names on design doc
Removed Maps Static API from README and design doc because it costs money per request
Debugged:
  Flask app:
    - removed unnecessary error messages since database functions already returns it
    - changed naming convention to match that in design doc
    - fixed python file to conform to PEP
  Database:
    - fixed importing to work with flask app
  Templates:
    - added a logout button to homepage

huangP -- 2019-11-22 22:36
Added functions to database manager:
  - add_stat(country) to add stats for the country if it is not in the database
  - has_stat(country) to check if stats for country is in database
  - get_country_stat(country) to get all the stats for a country as a dictionary
Added to db_build in database builder to fill countries table if it is still empty when Flask app starts
Renamed stylesheet to match the href in homepage template

huangP -- 2019-11-24 23:01
Updated database tables:
  - added conversion column to stat table to denote whether a currency conversion is possible
    (2 = no, 1 = yes and data already pulled from API, 0 = yes but data not pulled from API)
Updated database functions:
  - get_country_stat now gets data from REST Countries API if the country stat is not already in db and then adds entry to db
    - when adding a new entry from API to db, it also checks with the Exchange Rates API to see if currency conversion is possible
  - get_name_stats now checks with the Agify.io API. If the data is not in the db, it is pulled from API and stored into db
  - delete has_currency because it is no longer used (since the conversion column takes care of it)
  - add_stat now takes into account the new conversion column
Added database functions:
  - get_currency(country) converts the country name to the currency code
  - get_currency_list(currency) returns a list of currencies that the given currency can be converted into,
    returning empty list if conversion is not available

chenE -- 2019-11-25 09:05
Fixed the countries function:
  -changed many different variables in accordance to the new database functions.
  -get the list of possible currency conversions and spits it out
  -took out more API stuff now that database can take information from the API

  Still broken, though

huangP -- 2019-11-26 11:52

The most recent answer (if correct) is highlighted

huangP -- 2019-12-01 09:43
Added a table to cache the countries found by the users. This allows multiple users to play their own quiz
and their progress is stored even if they logout.
Updated quiz.html so that the check is case insensitive but displays the correctly capitalized country name
Added a button to reset the quiz.

huangP -- 2019-12-01 11:16
