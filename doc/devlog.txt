Procedures/protocols we will observe to make more awesome

  - ask for help when needed and don’t shame the person asking
  - keep code organized and readable by other people (comments! and PEP styling)

Merged api_backend with master branch
Added wheel to requirements.txt and tested it on new virtual environment
Made sure login mechanism and homepage are fully functioning. (Other routes do not crash but are mostly empty)
Debugged:
  Flask app:
    - removed unnecessary error messages since database functions already returns it
    - changed naming convention to match that in design doc
    - fixed python file to conform to PEP
  Database:
    - fixed importing to work with flask app
  Templates:
    - added a logout button to homepage
    - added blank country.html and results.html to be worked on by Ben
Bug found (to be fixed):
  - in /country, the variable country is sometimes used before it's defined
  - also in /country, unclear whether country is alpha-2 code or country name (both instances are used)
